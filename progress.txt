## Code Simplification (code-simplifying skill)

### Changes applied to clone.go:

1. Extracted `cloneMapExact` generic helper to eliminate repetitive nil-check + `maps.Clone` pattern
   across 7 map fast-path cases in `Clone()`. Each case was 4 lines (nil check, return src, maps.Clone,
   return) reduced to 1 line using the shared helper — mirrors the existing `cloneSliceExact` pattern.

2. Preserved exhaustive `reflect.Kind` switch listings in `structInfo` and `cloneValue` to satisfy
   the project's `exhaustive` linter configuration.

### Verification:
- All tests pass (`make test`)
- All linters pass (`make lint`)
- No behavioral changes — only implementation clarity improvements
